        As far as culinary staples go, fruit salad is an elder—it has been
        around for generations and it isnt going anywhere. A fruit salad will
        always be easy, but a good fruit salad involves more than just a chop
        and a toss. At their best, fruit salads deliver an unexpected
        combination of color and contrast, and more often than not, include the
        small but substantive additions from spices, herbs, and aromatics that
        frame the lushness of the produce. The following version is one that I
        enjoyed for several months after having my baby, a combination of
        berries, stone fruit, melons, underripe mangoes, kiwi, and pineapple.
        The fruit is seasoned with a heady combination of sweet honey and
        ferocious Angostura bitters, accentuated by Tajín, nutmeg, and salt. The
        result is a familiar salad with flavors that taste fresh and exciting,
        even though you likely have many of the ingredients on hand.
