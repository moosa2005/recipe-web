      Modeled after Thai pad kra pao, this simple, speedy chicken stir-fry is
      wonderful for summer—and beyond. Where the traditional version uses
      fresh chiles, this recipe replaces them with bottled sambal oelek to
      keep things pantry-friendly. Combined with oyster sauce, fish sauce, and
      a bit of sugar, it’s a savory-spicy explosion of flavor that belies how
      quickly the dish comes together. Vigorously stirring the ground meat
      with a bit of liquid yields a bouncy texture, while the baking soda
      contributes to a juicy end result. This two-pronged approach transforms
      a lean protein (that often tastes dry) into something springy and
      tender. <br />
      Sweet basil is an excellent substitute for the holy basil of the
      original; use the latter if you can find it. Outside of summer, swap in
      an equal quantity of baby spinach. Ground turkey or ground beef work
      well in place of the ground chicken.

    It’s simple to make basil rice, and it’s perfect for when you have fresh
    basil on hand. Whether it’s fresh from your garden or leftover from the
    store, it works perfectly to make an impressive and easy side dish. Here’s
    what you’ll need:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <b>
      <li>White long grain rice</li>
      <li>Salted Butter</li>
      <li>lemon</li>
      <li>Fresh Basil</li>
    </b>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        Place the rice in a fine mesh strainer and rinse it under cold water,
        then drain and shake dry.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Place the rice in a saucepan with 1 ½ cups water and ¼ teaspoon of the
        kosher salt. Bring to a boil, then turn the heat to low. Cover and
        simmer 12 to 15 minutes, until the water is completely absorbed.
        Remove from the heat, cover and allow it to rest for 10 minutes.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Fluff the rice with a fork. Stir in the butter, minced garlic, basil,
        lemon zest and juice (if using), and ¼ teaspoon kosher salt. Taste and
        add additional salt if necessary. Serve immediately or store leftovers
        refrigerated for up to 5 days; reheat gently on the stovetop with a
        tablespoon of water. Keep in mind, the color of the basil darkens
        after refrigeration, so if making in advance, add the basil directly
        before serving.
